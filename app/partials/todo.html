                <p class="projectDescription">This to-do list was built over the weekend during my sixth week at The Iron Yard for Front-End Engineering. This application keeps track of all your tasks, all your current tasks, and all your completed tasks. It features an always visible "Enter Task" input located at the bottom of your screen. It also features a user-friendly message that changes based off your current task completion status.</p>
                <p class="projectDescription">Click the tabs at the bottom of the application to quickly switch between all your tasks, all your current tasks, and all your completed tasks. All information on this application is persisted using localstorage, so feel free to leave and come back to it as need be!</p>
